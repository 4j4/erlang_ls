# Support

Thank you for using Erlang LS! :tada:

This document offers some guidelines when asking for support related to an issue
you might be having with the Erlang LS tool.

We will always try to help as much as we can. This is an open-source project and
as such the people that work on and maintain it do so with the time they have
available. Please keep this in mind when setting your expectations.

# Guidelines

These aresome general guidelines to follow when reaching out through any of the
available support channels.

1. **Search through the existing
   [issues](https://github.com/erlang-ls/erlang_ls/issues/) before opening a new
   one**

   Check if one already exists related to the issue you are having. Remember
   to include `closed` issues as well.

2. **Provide as much context and information as possible**

   It is much more likely that others will be able to help you if they can
   reproduce the issue your are experiencing.

3. **Be nice**

   This can be applied to life in general, but it's specially important when
   communicating only through written text.
