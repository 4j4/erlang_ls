Not just for MFA, but for everything
We could use epp and erl_syntax_lib, a la vscode/lsp_navigation
How to get column numbers?
+ [ ] Completion (resolve, ido style, lack of erlang-sense)
- [ ] Completion on hover
+ [ ] Snippets (e.g. try catch)
- [ ] Completion of export list
- [ ] Complete list of keywords
- [ ] Indentation via erl_tidy
+ [ ] edoc
+ [ ] Find all callers
+ [ ] Actions to automatically case/pattern match on return values
+ [ ] Get compiler options from build tool
+ [ ] Support for multiple BEAM languages and delegation to servers
+ [ ] Redbug
- [ ] Signature Help
- [ ] shutdown method
- [ ] exit method
- [ ] preorder traversal of tree, stopping once range exceeded
** Emacs
- [ ] Add lsp-erlang to emacs-lsp
** Bugs
- [ ] tcp errors displayed on client
- [ ] Handle dialyzer return value on compilation errors
- [ ] Properly figure out MFA under point for goto-definitions
- [ ] Use column (maybe full length) when reporting compilation errors
- [ ] Ensure /tmp/*.erl files exist in a random dir
- [ ] Completion-at-point calls result in three separate completion requests
** Sourcer
- [ ] signatureHelpProvider: (
- [ ] didChangeConfiguration notification to swap OTP version
- [ ] avoid spawning by using cast for notifications?
** vscode_erlang
- [ ] epp and erl_lint instead of compile:file
